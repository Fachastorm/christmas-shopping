# ChristmasShopping

Welcome to the Chrismtas Shopping app. This app will allow you to create a christams list so you can keep track of everyone you are buying gifts for. The app allows you to see your list of people as well as the gifts you are getting them. It also shows you ALL the people who are getting gifts, but they are anonymous as you can't see what other people are getting as gifts either!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'christmas_shopping'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install christmas_shopping
